  "response_text": "You can add a live translation service for official meetings by using one of these approaches:  Professional Interpreter Services:  Hire certified interpreters who provide simultaneous or consecutive interpretation.  Can be done in-person or remotely via video conferencing.  Video Conferencing Platforms with Built-in Translation:  Zoom: Offers simultaneous interpretation for multiple languages.  Microsoft Teams: Has live captions and translation options.  Webex: Supports real-time translation and closed captioning.  Third-Party Real-Time Translation Tools:  KUDO or Interactio: Platforms specifically designed for multilingual meetings.  AI-based translation: Tools like Microsoft Translator or Google Meet captions can provide live translation, though accuracy may vary for official/legal contexts.  Hardware Solutions for Large Conferences:  Wireless headsets connected to interpreter channels for simultaneous translation.  For official meetings, professional interpreters are usually required for accuracy and compliance, especially if legal or formal decisions are involved.  If you want, I can outline a step-by-step setup for a Zoom meeting with live translation. Do you want me to?",
