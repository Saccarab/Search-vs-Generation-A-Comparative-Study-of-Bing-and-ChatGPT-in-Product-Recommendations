These updates include tools for chat-based editing, and the ability to create personalized podcasts and pitch presentations from PDF content. The \\\"Generate Podcast\\\" feature provides audio summaries of documents—like notes, reports, and transcripts—using a Microsoft GPT model for transcription and a Google voice model, although Adobe may switch to its proprietary models later. Additionally, the \\\"Generate Presentation\\\" feature leverages Adobe Express tools to create visual summaries with editable presentation templates. Users can guide the AI to focus on specific insights in the documents. The Acrobat AI assistant also now supports in-document edits through natural language prompts, enabling actions such as adding signatures, removing or modifying text, and other PDF alterations—similar to features introduced to Adobe Express in 2025.\",\"ref_id\":{\"turn_index\":0,\"ref_type\":\"news\",\"ref_index\":25},\"pub_date\":1769004000,\"attribution\":\"www.theverge.com\"}]},{\"type\":\"search_result_group\",\"domain\":\"sonix.ai\",\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"search_result\",\"url\":\"https://sonix.ai/resources/best-transcription-apps-for-speech-to-text/\",\"title\":\"11 Best AI Transcription Apps for Speech-to-Text in 2025\",\"snippet\":\"Mar 4, 2025 — AI transcription apps turn your audio into text quickly and accurately – up to 99% in some cases.

The app now supports MP3, M4A, and WAV formats and automatically transcribes uploaded audio, extracts key points, highlights important quotes or action items, and generates clear summaries. This update caters especially to users looking to convert meetings, lectures, interviews, or voice notes into searchable, organized documents. According to Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, this was the most requested user feature.\\n\\nUsers can access the feature via the plus menu on mobile or \\\"Upload files\\\" on the web. Audio upload limitations include a cap of 10 files at once with a total duration not exceeding 10 minutes for free users—double the five-minute video limit. Paid users receive higher caps. However, the 10-file per prompt rule still applies universally to all upload types.
