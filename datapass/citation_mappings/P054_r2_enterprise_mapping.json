This tool uses speech-to-speech translation and can simulate a user's personal voice in another language. Initially supporting up to nine languages, this feature is part of broader AI enhancements within Teams. Additionally, multilingual transcription for up to 31 languages will be supported for meeting transcripts.\n\nOther enhancements include AI-powered summaries of visual content from PowerPoint or the web shown during meetings, and the ability of Microsoft Copilot to summarize files shared in the Teams chat. Microsoft will also roll out a Teams Super Resolution feature for Copilot Plus PCs using local NPU chips to improve video call quality under weak internet conditions. Developers will gain access to image super resolution APIs, and updates to the Copilot Runtime will introduce functions such as image segmentation, object erase, and image description.",
