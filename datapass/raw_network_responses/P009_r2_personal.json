These updates include tools for chat-based editing, and the ability to create personalized podcasts and pitch presentations from PDF content. The \\\"Generate Podcast\\\" feature provides audio summaries of documents—like notes, reports, and transcripts—using a Microsoft GPT model for transcription and a Google voice model, although Adobe may switch to its proprietary models later. Additionally, the \\\"Generate Presentation\\\" feature leverages Adobe Express tools to create visual summaries with editable presentation templates. Users can guide the AI to focus on specific insights in the documents. The Acrobat AI assistant also now supports in-document edits through natural language prompts, enabling actions such as adding signatures, removing or modifying text, and other PDF alterations—similar to features introduced to Adobe Express in 2025.\",\"ref_id\":{\"turn_index\":0,\"ref_type\":\"news\",\"ref_index\":23},\"pub_date\":1769004000,\"attribution\":\"www.theverge.com\"}]},{\"type\":\"search_result_group\",\"domain\":\"www.investopedia.com\",\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"search_result\",\"url\":\"https://www.investopedia.com/jump-ai-notetaking-app-smart-practice-review-11885499\",\"title\":\"This Advisor-Focused AI Tool Can Replace an Entire Meeting Workflow\",\"snippet\":\"Jump is a specialized AI-powered client meeting assistant tailored for financial advisors, streamlining the workflow before, during, and after meetings.

This expansion aims to allow users to pose complex queries in their native languages.\\n\\nThe NotebookLM tool also received an upgrade, enabling users to generate reports in varied formats—including blog posts, study guides, flashcards, and quizzes—in over 80 languages. Users can tailor the tone, structure, and format of reports derived from uploaded content.

This update caters especially to users looking to convert meetings, lectures, interviews, or voice notes into searchable, organized documents. According to Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, this was the most requested user feature.\\n\\nUsers can access the feature via the plus menu on mobile or \\\"Upload files\\\" on the web. Audio upload limitations include a cap of 10 files at once with a total duration not exceeding 10 minutes for free users—double the five-minute video limit. Paid users receive higher caps. However, the 10-file per prompt rule still applies universally to all upload types.

The most notable improvement is the Gemini app's new ability to accept audio file uploads—previously the top user request. Free users can upload up to 10 minutes of audio per day with five prompts, while AI Pro and Ultra users can upload up to three hours across 10 files, including ZIP formats.\\n\\nIn addition, Google's AI Mode in Search now supports five new languages: Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese, facilitated by Gemini 2.5 integration. This expansion aims to allow users to pose complex queries in their native languages.\\n\\nThe NotebookLM tool also received an upgrade, enabling users to generate reports in varied formats—including blog posts, study guides, flashcards, and quizzes—in over 80 languages. Users can tailor the tone, structure, and format of reports derived from uploaded content. These new features are expected to be fully available by the end of the week.\\n\\nThese updates are part of a broader wave of Gemini enhancements, including personalized user recall, and video creation features in Workspace and Google Photos introduced in August and September.\",\"domain\":\"The Verge\"},{\"url\":\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TechnologyProTips/comments/1ftt4xi/looking_for_an_app_or_website_that_converts_audio/\",\"title\":\"Looking for an app or website that converts audio to text ...\",\"description\":\"I've been using MegaTranscript for transcribing English audio and it nails clear speech with 99.9% accuracy.
