users interact with PDF documents. These updates include tools for chat-based editing, and the ability to create personalized podcasts and pitch presentations from PDF content. The \"Generate Podcast\" feature provides audio summaries of documents—like notes, reports, and transcripts—using a Microsoft GPT model for transcription and a Google voice model, although Adobe may switch to its proprietary models later. Additionally, the \"Generate Presentation\" feature leverages Adobe Express tools to create visual summaries with editable presentation templates. Users can guide the AI to focus on specific insights in the documents.

Users can upload up to 10 audio files at once, provided their combined length doesn't exceed the time limit. Compatible formats include MP3, AAC, and WAV. To begin, users can access Gemini via its website or app, select the upload option, and choose their desired audio file. Once uploaded, a prompt like \"transcribe this speech\" initiates the process. If an error occurs, retrying usually resolves the issue. Transcriptions are generated quickly, though they may include filler words (e.g., \"uhms\" and \"ahs\"). Users can instruct Gemini to clean the transcript by prompting it to remove such filler words. Additionally, Gemini can help summarize the audio or extract key points, making it a versatile tool for various transcription needs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1761544800,"attribution":"www.tomsguide.com"}]}]},{"v":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.lifewire.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.lifewire.com/plaud-launches-note-pro-11798504","title":"Plaud Note Pro Launches With a Button for Real-Time Highlights","snippet":"Plaud has launched the Note Pro, a new AI-powered note-taking device designed to simplify capturing and organizing key points from meetings and conversations.

Equipped with four high-precision microphones, the Note Pro can accurately capture audio from up to 16 feet away and differentiate between calls and in-person meetings.\n\nThe device offers up to 50 hours of continuous recording on a single charge, making it suitable for extended use without frequent recharging. It pairs with the upcoming Plaud App 3.0, which will bring multimodal input support, smarter insights, improved \"Ask Plaud\" capabilities, and a new user interface.

The app now supports MP3, M4A, and WAV formats and automatically transcribes uploaded audio, extracts key points, highlights important quotes or action items, and generates clear summaries. This update caters especially to users looking to convert meetings, lectures, interviews, or voice notes into searchable, organized documents. According to Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, this was the most requested user feature.\n\nUsers can access the feature via the plus menu on mobile or \"Upload files\" on the web. Audio upload limitations include a cap of 10 files at once with a total duration not exceeding 10 minutes for free users—double the five-minute video limit. Paid users receive higher caps. However, the 10-file per prompt rule still applies universally to all upload types. Despite these boundaries, the generous audio allowances and robust summarization capabilities make this a valuable addition to Gemini’s AI toolset.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1757416860,"attribution":"www.androidcentral.com"}]}]},{"v":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"arxiv.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11967","title":"Take the aTrain.

Users can upload up to 10 audio files at once, provided their combined length doesn't exceed the time limit. Compatible formats include MP3, AAC, and WAV. To begin, users can access Gemini via its website or app, select the upload option, and choose their desired audio file. Once uploaded, a prompt like \"transcribe this speech\" initiates the process. If an error occurs, retrying usually resolves the issue. Transcriptions are generated quickly, though they may include filler words (e.g., \"uhms\" and \"ahs\"). Users can instruct Gemini to clean the transcript by prompting it to remove such filler words. Additionally, Gemini can help summarize the audio or extract key points, making it a versatile tool for various transcription needs.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"tomsguide.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":1369,"end_idx":1369,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Convert Audio to Text: Free, Instant AI Transcription","url":"https://otter.ai/audio-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Otter.ai"},{"title":"Audio to Text Converter Free Audio transcription","url":"https://www.notta.ai/en/tools/audio-to-text-converter?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Notta"},{"title":"Convert Audio to Text Free | AI Transcription Tool - Happy Scribe","url":"https://www.happyscribe.com/audio-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"HappyScribe"},{"title":"Free Audio to Text Converter - Transcribe Audio Online | AudioToText.com","url":"https://audiototext.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"AudioToText"},{"title":"Free, Unlimited AI Speech to Text Converter | SoundWise.ai","url":"https://soundwise.ai/speech-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Soundwise"},{"title":"Transcribe Audio to Text: AI Transcription Software | Restream","url":"https://restream.io/tools/transcribe-audio-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Restream"},{"title":"Transcribe Audio and Video to Text | TurboScribe","url":"https://turboscribe.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"TurboScribe"},{"title":"Transcribe audio with Google Gemini for free - here's how to do it","url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/google-gemini/transcribe-audio-with-google-gemini-for-free-heres-how-to-do-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"tomsguide.com"}],"has_images":false}]},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls/0","o":"replace","v":"https://audiototext.com/"},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls/1","o":"replace","v":"https://audiototext.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls/2","o":"replace","v":"https://otter.ai/audio-to-text"},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls/3","o":"replace","v":"https://otter.ai/audio-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com"},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls/4","o":"replace","v":"https://restream.io/tools/transcribe-audio-to-text"},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls/5","o":"replace","v":"https://restream.io/tools/transcribe-audio-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com"},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls","o":"append","v":["https://soundwise.ai/speech-to-text","https://soundwise.ai/speech-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://turboscribe.ai/","https://turboscribe.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.happyscribe.com/audio-to-text","https://www.happyscribe.com/audio-to-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.notta.ai/en/tools/audio-to-text-converter","https://www.notta.ai/en/tools/audio-to-text-converter?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/google-gemini/transcribe-audio-with-google-gemini-for-free-heres-how-to-do-it","https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/google-gemini/transcribe-audio-with-google-gemini-for-free-heres-how-to-do-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com"]},{"p":"/message/metadata","o":"append","v":{"is_complete":true,"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"usefulai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://usefulai.com/tools/ai-transcription?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"9 Best AI Transcription Tools for 2025 (17 Reviewed)","snippet":"AI Transcription Tools are software applications that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help you transcribe audio and video recordings into text.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1730505600,"attribution":"usefulai.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"converter.app","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://converter.app/audio-to-text/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Audio to Text - Free AI Transcription | Converter App","snippet":"Transcribe Audio to Text Online with AI Converter App uses AI to transcribe audio to text — free, private, unlimited.
