    "<h4>CSMSO by Market Type (ChatGPT cited sources vs. Bing)</h4> <p>The boxplots show median overlap is lowest in Niche/Emerging, moderate in High-Involvement/High-Cost, and variable in Commodity/Saturated with a wide spread and some high-overlap cases. Overall alignment between ChatGPT citations and Bing organic results is modest across all market types.</p> <ul> <li>Commodity/Saturated markets often share authoritative, evergreen sources (major brands, top publishers), so Bing and ChatGPT can converge; variability reflects SERP competition and mixed intents (reviews, “best of,” specs).</li> <li>Niche/Emerging queries fragment authority and favor freshness; Bing surfaces newer/long-tail pages while ChatGPT’s synthesis may cite developer docs or scattered posts, reducing overlap.</li> <li>High-Involvement/High-Cost queries tilt toward reviews/specs that partially align; ChatGPT’s deduplication and summary behavior can keep a core set while Bing diversifies domains (retailers, forums), limiting full match.</li> </ul>"

    "<h4>CSMSO by Query Level (G → G+P → G+P+F → G+P+F+F)</h4> <p>The boxplots show the highest overlap for general (G) queries. Overlap drops sharply when a product is specified (G+P), partially rebounds with one feature constraint (G+P+F), and is lowest when two feature constraints are added (G+P+F+F). The general trend is decreasing overlap as constraints increase.</p> <ul> <li>Adding product and feature filters narrows candidate sets and shifts SERPs toward variant/retailer pages; ChatGPT often cites brand docs and review roundups to satisfy constraints, reducing domain match.</li> <li>Single-feature queries sometimes align because both systems surface spec/review pages optimized for that attribute (intent match, vertical relevance); a second feature pushes results into long-tail pages with low shared authority.</li> <li>LLM behaviors (constraint satisfaction and cross-source synthesis with deduplication) favor a few canonical sources, while Bing’s diversity and freshness weighting broaden domains, lowering overlap.</li> </ul>"

    "<h4>CSMSO by Query Level (ChatGPT: All Sources)</h4> <p>When all ChatGPT sources are considered, general (G) queries still show the highest overlap, with a clear decline once product and feature constraints are added. However, overlap partially recovers for single-feature (G+P+F) queries before falling again at two-feature (G+P+F+F) level.</p> <ul> <li>General queries align because both systems favor high-authority explanatory pages and established informational domains.</li> <li>Adding product constraints narrows the SERP and introduces brand-specific heterogeneity; Bing diversifies retail links while ChatGPT retains core brand and review domains.</li> <li>The rebound at G+P+F reflects overlapping coverage of specification and comparison content, while the final decline shows how deeper constraints push ChatGPT into focused, low-overlap sources outside Bing’s top results.</li> </ul>"
