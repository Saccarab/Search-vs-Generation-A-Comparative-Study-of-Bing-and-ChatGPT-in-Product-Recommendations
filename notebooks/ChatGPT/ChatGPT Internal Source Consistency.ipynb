    "<p>To evaluate how consistent ChatGPT is in the sources it cites across multiple runs of the same query, we define the Mean Internal Source Overlap (MISO).

    "<h4>All-Source Consistency by Market Type</h4> <p>The boxplots compare ChatGPT’s <em>Mean Internal Source Overlap (MISO)</em> when considering <em>all sources mentioned in its responses</em>(both cited and uncited) across market types. Commodity/Saturated queries show the highest median overlap, followed by Niche/Emerging and High-Involvement/High-Cost, though all exhibit moderate dispersion.</p> <ul> <li>Commodity markets rely on stable, high-authority domains repeatedly surfaced in retrieval, producing strong internal overlap across runs.</li> <li>Niche markets involve smaller and more volatile source pools; variation in retrieval and synthesis reduces consistency in total sources used.</li> <li>High-involvement categories draw from heterogeneous verticals (reviews, retailers, forums), so ChatGPT samples more diverse inputs and overlaps less.</li> <li>Differences mainly reflect market concentration and SERP stability, not generation randomness—ChatGPT’s retrieval layer is more consistent where authority and intent signals dominate.</li> </ul>"
