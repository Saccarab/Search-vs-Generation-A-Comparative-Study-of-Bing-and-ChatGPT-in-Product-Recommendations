Fast & simple (no setup)  Google Docs: Open a doc → Tools → Voice typing → play the audio near your mic.  Otter.ai: Upload the audio → get a transcript (good accuracy, free tier).  Notta / Sonix / Descript: Upload → download text.  If you want the best accuracy (and control)  Whisper (OpenAI): Very accurate, supports many languages.  Works via apps, websites, or locally if you’re technical.  On your phone  iPhone: Voice Memos → Transcribe (iOS 17+).  Android: Google Recorder → automatic transcription.  Offline / privacy-focused  Whisper (local install) or Vosk: No upload, runs on your computer.  If you want, tell me:  file type (mp3, wav, etc.)  device (phone, Mac, Windows)  whether accuracy or speed matters more  I’ll point you to the exact best option.",
