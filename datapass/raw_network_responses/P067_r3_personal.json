  "response_text": "You can add live translation to official meetings by using one of these approaches:  Built-in platform features:  Zoom: Has a “Language Interpretation” feature where interpreters can broadcast in real-time.  Microsoft Teams: Offers live captions and translations, though full multilingual audio may need add-ons.  Webex: Supports real-time translation and interpreters.  Third-party services:  Interprefy, Kudo, VoiceBoxer: Professional platforms for multilingual live interpretation.  These integrate with your video conferencing platform and let participants choose their language channel.  Hybrid approach:  Use a separate app or service for interpreters and share the audio via a secondary channel (phone line, app, or embedded in the meeting).  You’ll need:  Qualified interpreters for each language.  Platform support for multiple audio channels.  Pre-meeting setup to assign interpreters and test connections.  If you want, I can make a short list of platforms with real-time translation and their key limits/capabilities for quick comparison. Do you want me to do that?",
