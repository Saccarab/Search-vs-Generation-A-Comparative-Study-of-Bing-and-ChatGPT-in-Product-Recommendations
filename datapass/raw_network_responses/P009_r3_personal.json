These updates include tools for chat-based editing, and the ability to create personalized podcasts and pitch presentations from PDF content. The \\\"Generate Podcast\\\" feature provides audio summaries of documents—like notes, reports, and transcripts—using a Microsoft GPT model for transcription and a Google voice model, although Adobe may switch to its proprietary models later. Additionally, the \\\"Generate Presentation\\\" feature leverages Adobe Express tools to create visual summaries with editable presentation templates. Users can guide the AI to focus on specific insights in the documents. The Acrobat AI assistant also now supports in-document edits through natural language prompts, enabling actions such as adding signatures, removing or modifying text, and other PDF alterations—similar to features introduced to Adobe Express in 2025.\",\"ref_id\":{\"turn_index\":0,\"ref_type\":\"news\",\"ref_index\":25},\"pub_date\":1769004000,\"attribution\":\"www.theverge.com\"}]},{\"type\":\"search_result_group\",\"domain\":\"www.investopedia.com\",\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"search_result\",\"url\":\"https://www.investopedia.com/jump-ai-notetaking-app-smart-practice-review-11885499\",\"title\":\"This Advisor-Focused AI Tool Can Replace an Entire Meeting Workflow\",\"snippet\":\"Jump is a specialized AI-powered client meeting assistant tailored for financial advisors, streamlining the workflow before, during, and after meetings.

Users can upload up to 10 audio files at once, provided their combined length doesn't exceed the time limit. Compatible formats include MP3, AAC, and WAV. To begin, users can access Gemini via its website or app, select the upload option, and choose their desired audio file. Once uploaded, a prompt like \\\"transcribe this speech\\\" initiates the process. If an error occurs, retrying usually resolves the issue. Transcriptions are generated quickly, though they may include filler words (e.g., \\\"uhms\\\" and \\\"ahs\\\"). Users can instruct Gemini to clean the transcript by prompting it to remove such filler words. Additionally, Gemini can help summarize the audio or extract key points, making it a versatile tool for various transcription needs.\",\"domain\":\"Tom's Guide\"},{\"url\":\"https://voicetonotes.ai/blog/best-voice-to-notes-app/\",\"title\":\"12 Best Voice to Notes Apps (2026) | Ranked & Reviewed\",\"description\":\"3 days ago — VoiceToNotes: Best Real-Time AI Transcription App with 99% Accuracy.
