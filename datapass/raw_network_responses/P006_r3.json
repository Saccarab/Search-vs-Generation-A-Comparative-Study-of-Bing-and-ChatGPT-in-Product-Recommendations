Users can upload up to 10 audio files at once, provided their combined length doesn't exceed the time limit. Compatible formats include MP3, AAC, and WAV. To begin, users can access Gemini via its website or app, select the upload option, and choose their desired audio file. Once uploaded, a prompt like \"transcribe this speech\" initiates the process. If an error occurs, retrying usually resolves the issue. Transcriptions are generated quickly, though they may include filler words (e.g., \"uhms\" and \"ahs\"). Users can instruct Gemini to clean the transcript by prompting it to remove such filler words. Additionally, Gemini can help summarize the audio or extract key points, making it a versatile tool for various transcription needs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1761544800,"attribution":"www.tomsguide.com"}]}]},{"v":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"arxiv.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15202","title":"TalkLess: Blending Extractive and Abstractive Speech Summarization for Editing Speech to Preserve Content and Style","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"academia","ref_index":31},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"arxiv.org"}]}]},{"p":"/message/metadata/search_result_groups/18/entries","v":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11967","title":"Take the aTrain.

Unlike Apple’s basic Voice Memos app, which many musicians use out of convenience, Dubnote is specifically designed for the early stages of songwriting. It introduces advanced features like automatic sectioning of recordings, tagging based on content, tempo detection, transcription of speech and lyrics, and time-stamped notes—all processed locally on the device for privacy. Users can organize recordings into customizable notebooks, import audio from other sources, and easily export full or partial files.\n\nThe app is available in both free and premium versions, with the premium tier priced at $24.99/year. However, for one day only—Wednesday, July 9, 2025—users can claim a lifetime Premium subscription at no cost. Vochlea CEO George Wright highlights that the app eliminates the chaos of disorganized audio snippets by making musical ideas easier to capture, organize, and revisit.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1752047700,"attribution":"www.musicradar.com"}]}]},{"p":"/message/status","o":"replace","v":"finished_successfully"},{"p":"","o":"add","v":{"message":{"id":"8a4318f3-8693-4e31-928a-381f25cc84f6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"sonicberry_model_id":"alpha.sonic_thinky_v1_paid","real_author":"tool:web","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1769505404.807926,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"in_progress","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","request_id":"aa46bc46-b1e0-489e-8503-a6bd5d886ed8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"47e6e592-93fe-4498-889f-eb41aca8ac25","turn_exchange_id":"780bee80-6aa9-40fe-b375-36ebb9a67147","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","is_available":false,"description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","is_available":false,"description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"gpt-5-1-pro","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","is_available":false,"description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"gpt-5-1-pro","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","is_available":false,"description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"gpt-5-pro","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","is_available":false,"description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"gpt-5-pro","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","is_available":false,"description":"This model doesn't support search."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"conversation_id":"69788277-171c-8012-9776-82c974bab656","error":null,"error_code":null},"c":7},{"type":"message_marker","conversation_id":"69788277-171c-8012-9776-82c974bab656","message_id":"8a4318f3-8693-4e31-928a-381f25cc84f6","marker":"user_visible_token","event":"first"},{"p":"/message/content/parts/0","o":"append","v":"Here are solid apps"},{"p":"","o":"patch","v":[{"p":"/message/content/parts/0","o":"append","v":"/AI"},{"p":"/message/metadata/safe_urls","o":"add","v":[]}]},{"p":"/message/content/parts/0","o":"append","v":" tools you can use to **transcribe"},{"v":" audio to text**:\n\n**Easy & popular**\n- **"},{"p":"","o":"patch","v":[{"p":"/message/content/parts/0","o":"append","v":"Otter.ai** – very common for meeting audio, quick uploads, decent accuracy. citeturn0search7  \n- **Rev (AI)** – simple upload → transcript workflow;
