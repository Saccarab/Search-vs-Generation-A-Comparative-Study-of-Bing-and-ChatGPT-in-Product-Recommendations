These updates include tools for chat-based editing, and the ability to create personalized podcasts and pitch presentations from PDF content. The \"Generate Podcast\" feature provides audio summaries of documents—like notes, reports, and transcripts—using a Microsoft GPT model for transcription and a Google voice model, although Adobe may switch to its proprietary models later. Additionally, the \"Generate Presentation\" feature leverages Adobe Express tools to create visual summaries with editable presentation templates.

Equipped with four high-precision microphones, the Note Pro can accurately capture audio from up to 16 feet away and differentiate between calls and in-person meetings.\n\nThe device offers up to 50 hours of continuous recording on a single charge, making it suitable for extended use without frequent recharging. It pairs with the upcoming Plaud App 3.0, which will bring multimodal input support, smarter insights, improved \"Ask Plaud\" capabilities, and a new user interface.

Users can upload up to 10 audio files at once, provided their combined length doesn't exceed the time limit. Compatible formats include MP3, AAC, and WAV. To begin, users can access Gemini via its website or app, select the upload option, and choose their desired audio file. Once uploaded, a prompt like \"transcribe this speech\" initiates the process. If an error occurs, retrying usually resolves the issue. Transcriptions are generated quickly, though they may include filler words (e.g., \"uhms\" and \"ahs\"). Users can instruct Gemini to clean the transcript by prompting it to remove such filler words. Additionally, Gemini can help summarize the audio or extract key points, making it a versatile tool for various transcription needs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1761544800,"attribution":"www.tomsguide.com"}]}]},{"p":"/message/metadata/search_result_groups/17/entries","v":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Polly","title":"Amazon Polly","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":28},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"v":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_%28app%29","title":"Spoken (app)","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":29},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"v":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Transcribe","title":"Live Transcribe","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":30},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"p":"/message/metadata/search_result_groups","v":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.androidcentral.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-gemini-app-feature-you-actually-wanted-is-here","title":"The Gemini app feature you actually wanted is here","snippet":"Google's Gemini app has launched a highly anticipated feature that allows users to upload and process audio files across Android, iOS, and the web.

This update caters especially to users looking to convert meetings, lectures, interviews, or voice notes into searchable, organized documents. According to Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, this was the most requested user feature.\n\nUsers can access the feature via the plus menu on mobile or \"Upload files\" on the web. Audio upload limitations include a cap of 10 files at once with a total duration not exceeding 10 minutes for free users—double the five-minute video limit. Paid users receive higher caps.

It introduces advanced features like automatic sectioning of recordings, tagging based on content, tempo detection, transcription of speech and lyrics, and time-stamped notes—all processed locally on the device for privacy. Users can organize recordings into customizable notebooks, import audio from other sources, and easily export full or partial files.\n\nThe app is available in both free and premium versions, with the premium tier priced at $24.99/year.
