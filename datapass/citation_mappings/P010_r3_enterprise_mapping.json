          "snippet": "Google Gemini now offers a free tool for transcribing audio files up to 10 minutes long. Users can upload up to 10 audio files at once, provided their combined length doesn't exceed the time limit. Compatible formats include MP3, AAC, and WAV. To begin, users can access Gemini via its website or app, select the upload option, and choose their desired audio file. Once uploaded, a prompt like \"transcribe this speech\" initiates the process. If an error occurs, retrying usually resolves the issue. Transcriptions are generated quickly, though they may include filler words (e.g., \"uhms\" and \"ahs\"). Users can instruct Gemini to clean the transcript by prompting it to remove such filler words. Additionally, Gemini can help summarize the audio or extract key points, making it a versatile tool for various transcription needs.",
