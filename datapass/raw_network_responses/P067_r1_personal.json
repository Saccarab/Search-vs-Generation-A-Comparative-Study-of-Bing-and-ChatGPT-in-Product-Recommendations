  "response_text": "You can add live translation to meetings using these approaches:  Built-in platform features:  Zoom: Offers “Language Interpretation” where interpreters can join and attendees select a language channel.  Microsoft Teams: Has live captions and translation for certain languages, and third-party apps can extend this.  Google Meet: Offers live captions in multiple languages, though full translation may need third-party tools.  Professional interpreting services:  Hire certified interpreters who can join virtually. Companies like LanguageLine, Stratus Video, or Boostlingo provide live remote interpreting.  AI-powered translation tools:  Tools like KUDO, Interactio, or Wordly integrate live translation with video calls. They can provide simultaneous translation in multiple languages.  Hardware setups (for in-person):  Use wireless interpretation systems where attendees select audio channels for their language.  For official meetings, certified human interpreters are recommended for accuracy, while AI services are faster but may have errors.  If you want, I can give a step-by-step setup for Zoom or Teams specifically. Do you want that?",
