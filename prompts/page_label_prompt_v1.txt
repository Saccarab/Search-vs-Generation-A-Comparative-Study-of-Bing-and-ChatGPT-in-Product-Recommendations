You are labeling a web page for a research dataset. Use ONLY the provided inputs (URL, title, snippet/meta, extracted text). Do NOT browse the web.

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown. No commentary. No trailing commas.
If info is missing, use empty string, 0, or [] — do NOT guess.

## Enums

### Type guidance (important)
- marketplace_directory: Pages that aggregate multiple software or products into a directory or category listing, often with user ratings and "Visit Website" buttons. Examples: Capterra, G2, SoftwareAdvice, GetApp.
- app_store_listing: Official app store or extension store pages for a specific product. Examples: Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Chrome Web Store, Edge Add-ons Store.
- listicle: Articles or blog posts titled like "Best [X] tools for [Y]" or "Top 10 [X]". Usually written by a publisher/author rather than being a automated directory.
- reference: high-authority neutral reference/encyclopedia/knowledge-base pages whose primary goal is factual description (not selling/reviewing). Examples: Wikipedia, official standards.

## Scales
promotional_intensity_score: integer 0–5
expertise_signal_score: integer 0–5
spamminess_score: integer 0–5
freshness_cue_strength: integer 0–5
readability_score: integer 0–5

## Binary fields (0/1)
has_pros_cons
has_clear_authorship
has_sources_or_citations
listicle_has_ranked_order

## Definitions
readability_score (0–5): How easy the page is to scan and understand based on the text structure (clear headings, concise paragraphs, simple language). 5 = exceptionally readable.
has_pros_cons (0/1): 1 if the page clearly contains a Pros/Cons section or equivalent.
has_clear_authorship (0/1): 1 if explicit author/editor attribution exists.
has_sources_or_citations (0/1): 1 if the page text indicates sources/references/citations.
freshness_cue_strength (0–5): Score based ONLY on explicit cues (e.g., "Updated Jan 2026", "2026 in title").

has_clear_authorship (0/1):
1 if explicit author/editor attribution exists (e.g., “By X”, bio, “Reviewed by”)
0 otherwise

has_sources_or_citations (0/1):
1 if the page text indicates sources/references/citations (e.g., “Sources”, “References”, footnotes, “According to …” with source context)
0 otherwise

freshness_cue_strength (0–5):
Score based ONLY on explicit cues visible in the provided title/snippet/meta/extracted text (do not guess).
Examples of cues: "Updated Jan 2026", "Last updated", "2025/2026" in title, "as of 2026", "new for 2026", changelog entries, "recently updated".
0 = no freshness/updated/current-year cues
1 = very weak cues (generic "new" wording without any year/date)
2 = some cues (a year is mentioned OR page has a dated timestamp but not clearly framed as updated/current)
3 = clear cues (explicit publish date OR clear year framing relevant to recency)
4 = strong cues (explicit "updated" date OR strong current-year framing)
5 = very strong cues (explicit "last updated" + current-year framing and/or multiple strong recency signals)

tone definitions (to disambiguate):
- promotional: marketing-leaning but still informational; highlights benefits/features; limited pressure; few/no aggressive CTAs.
- salesy: high conversion pressure; repeated CTAs ("buy", "sign up", "start free trial"), urgency/scarcity ("limited time"), discounts/pricing emphasis, lead-capture funnels.

## Listicle extraction rules (only if type == "listicle")
- Extract up to 25 items into listicle_products.
- Only include items clearly recommended/compared in the provided text.
- position_in_listicle: use explicit numbering if present; else order of appearance (start at 1).
- product_domain: ONLY set this if an explicit URL or domain for that item appears in the provided extracted text. Otherwise leave as empty string (do NOT infer domains from product/brand names).
- is_host_domain: 1 if product_domain == listicle_domain, else 0.
- notes: MUST include a short snippet from the provided text showing the item mention (for auditability). If you found an explicit URL/domain for the item, include it in notes as well.

## Bias definition (0/1)
bias (0/1): Set bias=1 ONLY if the host's own domain is listed as an item AND it is ranked #1.
